<h2 align="center">Setup for Windows </h2>
Definitely the easiest way to run the program. To set it up for building and running the program, do the following:
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository (or if given it in .zip form, unzip it) </li>
  <li>Download Visual Studio (Tested on 2019) and ensure that the .NET desktop development is selected </li>
  <li>Open DungeonSim.sln. From here you can see all the code and files</li>
  <li>Click "Debug" -"Start without debugging" This will build the project and run it</li>
</ol>
You also could simply open DungeonSim->DungeonSim->bin->Debug->DungeonSim.exe. This will run the program that we have already compiled.

<p>For now:
<ol>
  <li>Follow the instructions in this link to download mono: https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin</li>
  <li>run <code>mono DungeonSim/DungeonSim/bin/Debug/DungeonSim.exe</code></li>
</ol>
This should run the program, but we will add the steps for the development environment
